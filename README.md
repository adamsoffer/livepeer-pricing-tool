# livepeer-pricing-tool

One liner: A tool for enhancing the price visibility in livepeer ecosystem. 

In detail:
* The Livepeer network contains various nodes (broadcasters, delegators, orchestrators/transcoders, and end-users), which work together to constitute a decentralized streaming service. 
* The orchestrators/transcoders are the heart of this network. These nodes handle the video transcoding operations and help the broadcasters in reaching out to users across various platforms. 
* However, there doesnâ€™t exist a solution for getting an overview of prices and fees being charged for the transcoding process in the network. 
* We aim to fill this void via the development of a Price Monitoring Tool for the network.
